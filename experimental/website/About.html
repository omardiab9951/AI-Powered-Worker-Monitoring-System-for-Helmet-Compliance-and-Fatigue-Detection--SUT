          <p>This website and the AI systems showcased here are the result of a student-led capstone project within the Computer & Engineering departments at El Sewedy University. The teams focused on two safety-critical problems: helmet detection for personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance and fatigue detection for worker/driver safety.</p>

        <h3>Project Story & Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Our journey started with a simple observation: manual monitoring of safety compliance is error-prone and expensive. We wanted to build an accessible, low-cost solution that can help campus security and industrial partners improve safety without intrusive hardware changes.</p>

        <p>The inspiration came from multiple sources — campus field visits, safety reports, and academic papers on vision-based PPE and drowsiness detection. We combined these insights with student research to curate the <strong>SUT El Sewedy University DataSet</strong> which captures realistic conditions such as occlusions, varying lighting, and different helmet styles.</p>

        <h4>What we built</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Helmet detection pipeline</strong> — object detection model with bounding box output and confidence scores.</li>
          <li><strong>Fatigue detection pipeline</strong> — eye/mouth landmark analysis and temporal aggregation for drowsiness scoring (PERCLOS / yawning detection).</li>
          <li><strong>Frontend demo website</strong> — this site, providing upload/camera UI, demo flows, and a dashboard prototype for clients.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Related work & previous reports</h3>
        <p>During the research phase, we created and referenced several support sites and reports to document design decisions and experiments. Notable references used in the prior report include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#">University microsite redesign — UX/UI report</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Object detection experiments and model selection notes</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Edge deployment tests — latency & resource benchmarks</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>These reports guided our dataset collection, annotation standards, and the choices made for model architectures and preprocessing techniques.</p>

        <h3>Students & Supervisors</h3>
        <p>This project was implemented by students at El Sewedy University under academic supervision. The team carried out data collection on campus, annotation, model training and evaluation, and frontend/backend integration.</p>

        <h3>Privacy & Ethics</h3>
        <p>We take privacy seriously. This prototype is intended for pilot evaluation with informed consent. For any live deployment, we recommend a privacy impact assessment, clear signage, and on-device processing where possible to avoid sending raw video to the cloud.</p>
